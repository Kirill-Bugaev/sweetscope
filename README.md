Vim plugin for cscope with improved quickfix list management

## Introduction

This plugin was written for using cscope tool in Vim easy and comfortable.

### Features
* Interactive query to cscope db
* Run cscope query for words under cursor or visually selected
* Two run methods of cscope query: Vim native and external
* Auto load cscope db for predefined file types
* Map predefined file types and quickfix buffer for cscope query
* Manage history of queries
* Save and load history of queries to\from file 
* Search and select in history of queries
* Restore quickfix stack after cscope query run, prepend quickfix flooding

### Default key maps
Just move cursor on interesting word or select it visually and use some of key maps below.

`Ctrl-\` + `\` - Interactive cscope query

`Ctrl-\` + `s` - Find this C symbol

`Ctrl-P` - Jump to previous in history quickfix list

`Ctrl-D` - Remove current quickfix list from history

## Options

### sweetscope_runmethod
Choose run method of cscope query. When `1` is setted Vim native query run will be used. For `0` external cscope program will be executed (by `system()` Vim function) for each query. Each method has slightly different output.
```vim
let g:sweetscope_runmethod = 1
```
(numeric, default `1`)

### sweetscope_filetypes
File types of Vim buffers for which plugin will automatically load cscope db and map keys for cscope query run. To apply plugin configuration for all Vim buffers set this list empty.
```vim
let g:sweetscope_filetypes = []
```
(list, default `['c', 'cpp', 'h']`)

### sweetscope_db_filename
File name of cscope db which plugin will search in working directory of each buffer  and load automatically if `g:sweetscope_autoload_db = 1`.
```vim
let g:sweetscope_db_filename = 'cscope.out'
```
(string, default `'cscope.out'`)

### sweetscope_autoload_db
Auto load cscope db toggle. If it is `1` cscope db defined in `g:sweetscope_db_filename` will be loaded automatically for each buffer which file type defined in `g:sweetscope_filetypes`.
```vim
let g:sweetscope_autoload_db = 1
```
(boolean, default `1`)

### sweetscope_query_maps
Switch on cscope query key maps for buffers which file types defined in `g:sweetscope_filetypes`. These key maps is used to run cscope query for word under cursor or visually selected.
```vim
let g:sweetscope_query_maps = 1
```
(boolean, default `1`)

### sweetscope_map_quickfix
Switch on cscope query key maps for quickfix buffer. These key maps is used to run cscope query for word under cursor or visually selected in quickfix buffer.
```vim
let g:sweetscope_map_quickfix = 1
```
(boolean, default `1`)

### sweetscope_qf_samewin
If `1` open quickfix buffer in the same window where current buffer opened when moving on history. If `0` new quickfix window will be opened (if it has not been opened yet).
```vim
let g:sweetscope_qf_samewin = 1
```
(boolean, default `0`)

### sweetscope_savehistory
Save history of cscope queries.
```vim
let g:sweetscope_savehistory = 1
```
(boolean, default `1`)

### sweetscope_historylength
Maximum length of history list.
```vim
let g:sweetscope_historylength = 100
```
(numeric, default `50`)

### sweetscope_history_maps
If `1` buffers which defined in `g:sweetscope_filetypes` will be mapped for history moving. This means that you can use the same as in quickfix keys in normal buffer for browse trough history lists. For most cases it is not necessary because history always displayed in quickfix window and quickfix buffer is always mapped. 
```vim
let g:sweetscope_history_maps = 1
```
(boolean, default `0`)

### sweetscope_map_qf_enter
If `1` plugin will update quickfix list in history every time you type Enter in quickfix window. I used with option when only start to write plugin. It seems that we don't need it anymore. Stayed as legacy.
```vim
let g:sweetscope_map_qf_enter = 1
```
(boolean, default `0`)

### sweetscope_open_after_current
If `1` new quickfix list generated by cscope query will be placed after current in history list. If `0` every new quickfix list will be appended to the end of history list.
```vim
let g:sweetscope_open_after_current = 1
```
(boolean, default `1`)

### sweetscope_searchopened
If `1` plugin will search already opened cscope quickfix list in quickfix stack and switch to it  when moving on history or running cscope query. It may make sence when current quickfix list doesn't belong to plugin, but may slow down history moving. If `0` new quickfix list in quickfix stack will be created each time you try to move on history and run cscope query if current quickfix list doesn't belong to plugin.
```vim
let g:sweetscope_searchopened = 1
```
(boolean, default `1`)

### sweetscope_noduplicate_qf
If `1` plugin will remove duplicate quickfix list from history on cscope query running. It is used to avoid cscope query lists with the same content.  If `0` duplicate list will be added to history. If this option is enabled it also may slow down new list opening on cscope query running.
```vim
let g:sweetscope_noduplicate_qf = 1
```
(boolean, default `1`)

### sweetscope_noduplicate_items
If `1` plugin will check quickfix list generated by cscope query and remove duplicate items. If this option is enabled it also may slow down new list opening on cscope query running.
```vim
let g:sweetscope_noduplicate_items = 1
```
(boolean, default `1`)

### sweetscope_save_qf_changes
If `1` plugin will save changes which has been made in quickfix buffer. This works only for deleting quickfix list items and not for changing text in quickfix buffer. So, no matter delete item or change its text, plugin will delete this item from corresponding list in history anyway. If this option is enabled it also makes quickfix buffer modifiable all time.
```vim
let g:sweetscope_save_qf_changes = 1
```
(boolean, default `1`)

### sweetscope_save_qf_stack
Vim native cscope query removes all quickfix lists after current from stack. If this option is enabled plugin will save quickfix stack before cscope query run and restore after.
```vim
let g:sweetscope_save_qf_stack = 1
```
(boolean, default `1`)

### sweetscope_clear_qf_stack
Each cscope query creates new quickfix list in quickfix stack. If this option is enabled plugin will save only one cscope list in quickfix stack, other cscope lists will be saved in history and it is possible to switch to it by history movement.
```vim
let g:sweetscope_clear_qf_stack = 1
```
(boolean, default `1`)

### sweetscope_history_file
It is file name where\from plugin will save\load history by default.
```vim
let g:sweetscope_history_file = 'sweetscope_history'
```
(string, default `'sweetscope_history'`)

### sweetscope_searchmaps
If `1` buffers which file types defined in `g:sweetscope_filetypes` will be mapped for history search engine. It means you can search in history word under cursor or visually selected. If this option disabled such key maps will work only in quickfix buffer and not in normal.
```vim
let g:sweetscope_searchmaps = 1
```
(boolean, default `1`)

### sweetscope_search_hl

```vim
let g:sweetscope_selectmaps = 1
```
(boolean, default `1`)

### sweetscope_sortselected

## Known bugs

### Duplicate quickfix lists when external cscope run method is used
When using external cscope run method (`g:sweetscope_runmethod = 0`) with
`g:sweetscope_save_qf_changes = 1` option quickfix lists can be duplicated.
This occurs because external run method can make output like this:
```
main.c|21| push(atof(s));
main.c|21| ^I^I^Ipush(atof(s));
```
This items treated by 'find duplicate items' engine as different, so both are
stayed in history in spite of they are duplicates. But after list appears in
quickfix window 'save quickfix changes' engine is started. It compares lines
in quickfix buffer with items of appropriate found list in history. Since
`^I^I^I` sequence is not displayed in quickfix buffer 'save quickfix changes'
engine can't find second item in quickfix buffer and deletes it. Then if you
try to repeat the same cscope query 'find duplicate qf' engine will not find
generated quickfix list in history and add it as unique, in spite of it is
duplicate (new list has `^I^I^I` sequence yet, but its duplicate in history
already not). 

To avoid this bug appears I recommend to use Vim native cscope run method
(`g:sweetscope_runmethod = 1`) or switch off 'save quickfix changes' option
(`g:sweetscope_save_qf_changes = 0`) if you want to use external run method.
